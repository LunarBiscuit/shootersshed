        <p>
            The booths are in a separate room and were designed to enable a group of friends to be able to have a private area for the evening where you can hang up your coats and bags, kick back and relax and have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can upgrade to a drinks/accessories package and if you do each booth has a buzzer system so you wonâ€™t have to go to the bar when you are ready for your next round of drinks. (Minimum of 4 persons and a maximum of 10 in each booth.
